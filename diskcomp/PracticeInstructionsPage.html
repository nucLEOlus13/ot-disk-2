            <p>In this experiment, you will be presented with three images on each trial:</p>
            
            <p>- One target image will appear at the bottom of the screen<br>
               - Two option images will appear on the left and right sides</p>
            
            <p>Your task is to choose the disk (located on the top of the screen) that looks like it was drawn by the same hand as the target (the bottom disk). 
                Ignore the amount of lines or how 'busy' the drawing looks. 
                Instead, look for the option that shares the same artistic 'handwriting' or drawing manner as the target.</p>
            
            <p>You can pause in between trials, but once you click on the cross icon to start the next trial, 
               you have to respond as fast as possible.</p>
            
            <p>There will be 400 trials in total, presented in four blocks of 100 trials. 
               You are invited to take a longer break after each of the blocks.
                There may be lags between trials which means it could take a few seconds for the next trial to configure.</p>
            
            <p>We will start with a practice session consisting three trials.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p>When you are ready, click the button to start the practice session.</p>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Start Practice</button>
